#Bitmarkets
========

Bitmarkets is a protocol and client used to implement a p2p online marketplace client using Bitmessage for communications and Bitcoin for payments. It also supports a decentralized review system.

##Protocol Specification
--------------------------

###Message format
-------------------

All messages are sent as JSON dictionaries in a bitmessage set to use the "SIMPLE" encoding with the JSON in the body section of the message. The subject field is a human readable comment ignored by the protocol but convenient for debugging in the format: "Bitmarkets/[message type]/[message hash]"


###Message objects
------------------

TimeSpace restrictions object

{
		responsePeriod: dt,
		deliveryTimeRange: [t1, t2],
		location: {
			// address with only restrictions specified, e.g. zip code or geospacial range
		}
}
